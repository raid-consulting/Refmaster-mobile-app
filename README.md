# Refmaster-mobile-app

Mobile app to record and transcribe meetings.

## Contributing notes

- Pull request tooling in this repo rejects binary attachments (e.g., audio or video recordings). Check the `.gitignore` before committing and avoid adding raw media files to version control. Share sample recordings through links or external storage instead of checking them into the repo.

## Implementation Plan
See [docs/implementation-plan.md](docs/implementation-plan.md) for the step-by-step delivery roadmap covering audio capture, transcription, and agenda alignment.
